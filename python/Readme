# This file contains our Python implementation of our tested algorithms
+ We implemented the four non-adaptive algorithms (i.e., RF, IM, CD, 2CD) and three adaptive algorithms (including Ada, LP and Ada+MGS)
+ During the validation, we find that the implementations cost lots of time to complete, which is unacceptable. Thus, we turn to a more efficient programming language C\#.
+ So we recommend the readers to use our C\# implementations instead of the Python version.
+ This file only serves as a repository of our previous code, just in case of possible usage at some time.
