# Introduction to the Files
+  The ten folders each contains the implementation of one algorithm tested in our paper. 
+  The implementation of each algorithm is based on IMM and thus follows the same pattern, where notably the algorithm is realized in Program.cs. And the realization of RR sets and some auxilary functions are inherited from \[[8](https://github.com/IDEAL-Lab/CIM)\]
+  The files suffixed with "ini100" or "ini1000" are generated by "initial.py" and record the initial users, i.e., set X in the paper. "reform.py" converts undirected graphs to directed graphs as required in the paper; assign the seed probability type to each user; and generate the threshold value for each user that is used in adaptive algorithms.
