# Introduction to the Results
+ Files suffixed with "o" record the results under setting S1 (i.e., 5% nodes with $p_u(c_u)=c_u^2$, 10% nodes with $p_u(c_u)=c_u$ and 85% with $p_u(c_u)=2c_u-c_u^2$), while files suffixed with "n" record the results under setting S2 (i.e., 15% nodes with $p_u(c_u)=c_u^2$, 20% nodes with $p_u(c_u)=c_u$ and 65% with $p_u(c_u)=2c_u-c_u^2$), and while files suffixed with "l" record the results under 1000 initial users (i.e., $|X|=1000$).
+ The numbers suffixed in the files indicate the content belongs to which algorithm. Specifically, the sorresponding relationship is "1-RF", "2-IM", "3-CD", "4-2CD", "5-Ada", "6-Ada+CD", "7-Ada+GS", "8-Ada+MGS", "9-A-Greedy" and "10-LP".
