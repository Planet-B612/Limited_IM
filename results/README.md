# Introduction to the Results
+ Files suffixed with "o" record the results under setting S1 (i.e., 5% nodes with $$p_u(c_u)=c_u^2$$, 10% nodes with $p_u(c_u)=c_u$ and 85% with $p_u(c_u)=2c_u-c_u^2$), while files suffixed with "n" record the results under setting S1 (i.e., 5% nodes with $p_u(c_u)=c_u^2$, 10% nodes with $p_u(c_u)=c_u$ and 85% with $p_u(c_u)=2c_u-c_u^2$),
